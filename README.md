## My process
I first coded the HTML part and then moved styling the page. It took a while to figure out the size ratios of the html elements, but I think, I got them right. 


### Built with
- VsCode
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

This was somewhat easy to code. I utilized a flexbox container.
For the image file, I had to update the URL link several times for it to work. Tried relaitve and direct links. It seems to be working now.


### Continued development

I want to learn more about using relative links to files.
Also, I want to learn more about simple designs. I probably did not need to use a flexbox here.
Finally, I did not use a media query but would like to use them in the future.
